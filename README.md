## tic-tac-toe
A tic-tac-toe bot that never loses.
Here I am using a mini-max algorithm to calculate the next best move for the bot. As we know, tic-tac-toe is a solved game so we are simply calculating moves to the end of the game tree rather than stopping at a certain depth which is what would be done for complex games like chess.
